An idea came after reading Laura Kalbag's [I don't track you](https://laurakalbag.com/i-dont-track-you/).
It is none of my business to know how do you read my site, and I am not interested in it neither.
Therefore, I am proudly to say that this site is tracking code free with the exception stated below.
