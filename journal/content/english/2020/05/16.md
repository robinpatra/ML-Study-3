Kickoff my Machine Learning journey today, by starting the A Cloud Guru's
[Introduction to Machine Learning](https://acloud.guru/learn/intro-machine-learning) course.

This introductory course is probably one of the most easy-to-understand I have ever watched.
Most of my previous experience is courses that throw **Rocket Science Magical Terms** and not easy to digest, and I close the tab not long afterwards.
Looking forward to seeing how far I can go this time.

So, I have learned the **NAND** logic gate and the underlying ground knowledge of different types of learning.
Such as supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning.
The course also demystified what the hell exactly is Machine Learning and some history of it.
