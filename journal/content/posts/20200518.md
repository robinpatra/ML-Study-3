Signed up Coursera's [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course and starting from 25 May.

Continue working on A Cloud Guru's [Introduction to Machine Learning](https://acloud.guru/learn/intro-machine-learning)
and learnt about the concept of different types of Neural Network a.k.a. Deep Learning.

Perceptron Neural Network (**Perceptron**) consists of a single layer of the neural network, and can only make a binary decision.

Convolutional Neural Network (**CNN**) for Image classification by rolling a small set of data point and find matchings.

Lab: [Convolutional Neural Network on Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b_nCX0T44gcItYfkJXB2kXBgOsb0sSUODvJkyziiRWU/edit?usp=sharing)

Recurrent Neural Network (**RNN**) for NLP by referring back to a previous word.

Generative Adversarial Network (**GAN**) for generating fake photos by two agents, one for creating the image and one for judging the result.

Also, a quick overview of Jupyter Notebook. Fantastic project and very useful. I may include it even for the documentation of my future JavaScript projects.
