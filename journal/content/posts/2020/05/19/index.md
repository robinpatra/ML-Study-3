I finished A Cloud Guru's [Introduction to Machine Learning](https://acloud.guru/learn/intro-machine-learning).
It talked about the project management lifecycle, risk, and ethical stuff of Machine Learning.

A great intro course confirmed. This course does not aim to make me become a Machine Learning pro overnight,
but enable me to communicate in Machine Learning language and a gateway to get into the Machine Learning world.

Next step for A Cloud Guru will be the three Project Lab (107, 208 and 301) in [Learning Resources](https://github.com/siutsin/k_days_machine_learning_journey#learning-resources).

Data Camp is offering a free weekend promotion. Hence, I started the [Intro to Python for Data Science](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science/)
to brush up my long-gone Python knowledge.

The course covered basic syntax stuff and an intro to [NumPy](https://numpy.org/).
