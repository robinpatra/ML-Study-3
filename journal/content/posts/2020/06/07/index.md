Found out JetBrains Academy on Reddit and give it a try for the Python course. Amazing.

The platform integrated well with PyCharm, and the learning experience is probably the best I have seen so far compares to the others I remember:
Pluralsight, Udemy (Best Rated Courses), Coursera, Udacity, A Cloud Guru, Linux Academy, Data Camp, Lynda, and a few random MOOC platforms.
(Disclaimer, I didn't get paid lol)

I noticed the web is calling `127.0.0.1` and interact/sync with the IDE directly. Very cool.

The intro course code is [here](https://github.com/siutsin/k_days_machine_learning_journey/tree/master/jetbrains-academy/Zookeeper).
